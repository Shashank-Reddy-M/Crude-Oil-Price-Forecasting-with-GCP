![291023644-0e75ab14-ea1b-418b-b3b3-e79925dafc65](https://github.com/Shashank-Reddy-M/Crude-Oil-Price-Forecasting-with-GCP/assets/114110108/0c9c4a6b-d687-4d36-b82f-381b419a268c)



Crude oil prices have a significant impact on both global and domestic economies. However, their inherent volatility makes it difficult to predict accurately (problem). Our analysis of historical pricing data and related economic indicators suggests that machine learning techniques can improve short-term forecasts (evidence). We recommend developing a longitudinal crude oil price prediction model utilizing streaming data and cloud-based infrastructure (recommendation). The model should incorporate features from debt markets, energy markets, currencies, and traditional macroeconomic indicators. Advanced feature engineering and neural network tuning processes are also advised to enhance predictive capabilities. Overall, an intelligent forecasting model could provide actionable insights for policymakers, businesses, and investors. 

This summarizes the key problem involving volatile crude oil prices, provides evidence from our analysis to support using machine learning for enhanced forecasting, and makes a specific recommendation for model development leveraging both statistical and deep learning techniques. The focus is on conveying the essence of the project and its potential value proposition clearly and concisely at a high level. Further details on the data, methodology, and results would follow in subsequent sections.
